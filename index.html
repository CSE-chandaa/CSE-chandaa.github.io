                    Medium is how the product will get to the costumer. Product is how the actual product will work and be designed. Feedback is how we will see how users respond the the website's UI and product. UI is how the user will use the website and 
                    navigate it. Monetization is how I will earn money from the site.

                    The first sketch is my about page with explains what the product is and what is fixes. The second sketch shows the UI for going through the steps of creating the roller. The third image (cover image) is what the user should end up with if they
                    follow the instructon; this will likely be at the bottom of the website for a reference and expectation.
